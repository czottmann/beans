Bean lists in the TUI must always be sorted by:
- status (in the order as defined in our code)
- type (within each status, in the order as defined in our code)

## Checklist
- [x] Implement sorting logic for beans by status order
- [x] Implement secondary sort by type order within each status
- [x] Apply sorting to TUI bean lists
- [x] Write tests for the sorting functionality
